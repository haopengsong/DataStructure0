#### Array-based & Linked-based stack implementation comparsion:
	- The array-based implementation is a reasonable choice if the number of items in the stack does not exceed the fixed size of the array
	- For stacks that might be large, the array-based implementation will waste storage. In this case, the link-based implementation is a better choice
